apt-cacher caches apt packages so that if they have been downloaded once, they will be fetched from a local cache rather than from the internet. This is useful because workers revert back to their "stock" install after every build. Since the same install packages and dependencies are redownloaded for each build, the installation step is significantly sped up with the use of apt-cacher.
